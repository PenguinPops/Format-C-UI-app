# FormatC++ UI Electron app

FormatC++ is a .exe program which takes unformatted code with enumeration and formats it to be copyable to a development environment.

This is a UI design version of the lone .exe program, enriched by proper design and internal text manipulation.

Proper use as follows:
  > Cloning of the repository
  > Adding node_modules to build the Electron app environment
  > Following the UI hints in the app

Functions as of right now:

    Recognition and deletion of numbers and spaces before code
    Recognition of brackets and proper formatting
    Deletion of empty lines
